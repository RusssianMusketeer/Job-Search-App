# Jobiendo

This was a job search web app, coming from the idea of serching for a job that can suit your needs. Mutiple filter options making the job search easier. I used the Muse API with get requests in order to display the information. The context API was use to put everything in one file and distribute the necessary states. This was my first introduction to React Hooks. The use of hooks allowed me redefine the usage of react and it's state architecture.



## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Sass, Javascript, Typescript

**Server:** Muse API



## Lessons Learned

This was my second bug project. I incorporated react hooks with the context API for state management. I did all the GET requests in one file and distributed the necessary logic to the adequate components. My first introduction to an external API and typescript. I liked to user the interface and type system it permited me to debug much easier. Lessons learned are react hooks and API requests for external servers.
